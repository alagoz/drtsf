# DRTSF: Diverse Representations and Transformations for Time Series Classification
Diverse Representations Time Series Features (DRTSF) is a novel feature-based approach for time series classification (TSC) that integrates a rich set of representations, including derivatives, Hilbert transform, DWT, FFT, DCT, and autocorrelation. By transforming time series into a unified feature vector, DRTSF captures intricate patterns across multiple domains, enabling superior predictive performance.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive Representation: Combines diverse statistical, temporal, and spectral features into a cohesive feature set.
- State-of-the-Art Accuracy: Outperforms other feature-based methods and achieves results comparable to top-performing TSC models like Quant.
- Efficiency: One of the fastest TSC frameworks, matching the computational speed of leading methods.
- Robust Generalization: Performs well on datasets with complex structures, such as long sequences or large class counts.

Highlights:
- Evaluated on 142 datasets from the UCR archive using a consistent experimental framework.
- Implements a fast and scalable pipeline, making it suitable for large-scale and real-time TSC tasks.
- Provides insights into feature selection and optimization, allowing for further customization based on dataset-specific needs.
